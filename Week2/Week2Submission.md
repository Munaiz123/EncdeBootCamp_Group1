- Developed scripts to interact with the blockchain:
- - DeployWithViem.ts
- - ReadBallotContract.ts
- - GiveVotingRight.ts


Scripts use viem to interact with the blockchain(sepolia mainnet) to deploy a Ballot.sol. Different scripts(files) take in different arguments which are indicated in the file comments. 

We were not able to write scripts for all of the Ballot.sol functions (Winner, winningProposal) but we learned how to use Viem within scripts. 

All interaction details can be found at the sepolia etherscan link above.
